# üõ†Ô∏è Fixing Elementor Compatibility in a Custom WordPress Theme

This repository provides a corrected version of `single-portfolio.php` for custom WordPress themes where **Elementor fails to load on single posts or portfolio items** due to a missing `the_content()` function.

---

## ‚ùå The Problem

Many WordPress themes conditionally load `the_content()` based on theme settings or content availability.  
This can break Elementor, which depends on `the_content()` to render the editor interface.

Example of the issue:

```php
if (theme_setting_enabled && $content) {
    the_content();
}
